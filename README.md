# Gin Gonic logging middleware, JSON format

I wanted to learn gin-gonic web framework and Golang, I ended up making a custom logger middleware...
Using encoding/json to convert structs straight into JSON, which is quite handy indeed.

## Rationale

To make logs more machine-readable and processable. Default formats are usually human-friendly.
